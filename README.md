# Weather Forecast

## Intro

Hello! I am Pinak Dwivedi.

## Description

I have created this project with Vite, HTML, CSS, and Typescript.
This is a weather forecast app with a very nice, simple, and compelling UI.

### How To Use

At first, it asks for your location access so that it can provide you with weather information about your location.
When you allow location access, it fetches current, hourly, and daily weather information about your location.
For the hourly section, there are 24 hours of forecast, and for the daily section, there are 7 days of forecast.
It also highlights the current day in the daily section and the current hour in the hourly section by scrolling to the current hour card very smoothly.
This app also facilitates light-dark mode.
There is a switch on the top right corner of the header, which can switch the theme from dark to light and vice versa.
So, users can enjoy the weather details in their desired theme while protecting their eyes.
